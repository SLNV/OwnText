## Brief Introduction

It's just a simple text document editing software. But its interface will be better than other software (as least I think so).

The Design concept of this software is:
 > concise, portable and multi function

But this project can only be carried out on weekends because since this is only a personal project.

## Development Language

At first, I decided to use C++ to develop this project, but then I found a problem: it's too complicated. As a personal project, it's obviously inappropriate to use C++.
But I also know some Python, so I decided to use Python to develop this project. At the beginning, I used Tkinter library, but its interface didn't suit me, so I used PyQt5 library for development. It makes the interface of this software looks great. So I decided to develop with PyQt5.
